Social media, maps, advertisements,… As a developer, you may add a few libraries, and before you know it, your app is exceeding the constraints of the Android platform.

I will show some optimized configurations that can help you to reduce the size of common libraries. If ProGuard isn’t sufficient, you may have to resort to more drastic techniques, such as dynamic class loading. I’ll discuss some techniques and their implications.

But it’s a mistake for developers to assume a game that succeeded with a Western audience will become an instant success in China – in fact, it’s often the case that the biggest Western games hardly make a dent in the Chinese market.\nChris Hanage, General Manager of Papaya Mobile and AppFlood for EMEA will analyse 10 successful games in China over the past 6-12 months, explaining why they succeeded and what inspiration they can give to Western developers hoping to increase their chances of successfully marketing their games in China.\nUsing case studies of real games launched in China, Chris’ presentation will give developers important insight into cultural differences relating to gameplay, graphics, content, imagery, in-game milestones, app size and monetisation strategies to be considered when planning and developing their app for a Chinese audience.","endDate":"2014-10-31T10:45:00.000Z","name":"Climbing over the Great Wall: Lessons to learn from China’s most successful Android games","presenters":[{"bio":"Chris Hanage is Managing Director for Europe at mobile distribution and monetisation company PapayaMobile.

That might be the reason Java has never been associated with high performance, but nowadays there are a lot of Java powered devices in the world and lots of people are building applications for them.\nCompilers that produce native machine code do a great optimisation job because they know where the code is going to be executed. But because of the portability feature, the Java Compiler could not assume anything about where our program is going to run and leaves all the optimisations to be done by the JVM while loading or, even, running our code (or converting it to native code in the case of ART)\nHaving that in mind, we will explore what can be done to help the compiler produce optimal code which, in fact, will make the life easier of the Dalvik VM or ART.\nIn this session you will not only learn how to make your Android code faster but also what to avoid when looking for critical performance and a bigger understanding of how the Java compiler works, and how these small changes affect to Dalvik VM and the new ART runtime.","endDate":"2014-10-31T15:20:00.000Z","name":"How to improve android app performance with the new ART Runtime and Dalvik VM","presenters":[{"bio":"Mobile Software Engineering Manager at Imagination","company":"Imagination","name":"Raimon Rafols","id":"-JyXSZKLkLi5Pa7z6Jpf"}],"rooms":[{"name":"Room 3","id":"-JyXSZHYW_mxbrWbuy9p"}],"startDate":"2014-10-31T14:35:00.000Z","track":{"color":"#FFFFEE58","name":"Develop","id":"-JyXSZKwmizILco6W-b5"},"type":"TALK","id":"-JyXSZIpFzuapfp4fsqy"},{"description":"Gone are the days where you can make an app or game and publish it to a single platform expecting a sure fire success. The best way to solve this problem is something I call “responsive game design” based on the same principles that work so well in responsive design for web apps. This framework includes the following key principles:  graphics and UI support multiple resolutions, game mechanics work across multiple types of input, publish to multiple platforms with the same codebase, and saved data is synced across all platforms.  During this talk we’ll cover how to apply this strategy to your own apps and games enabling them to scale across desktop, mobile, tablet and even TV.\nWe’ll walk you through controller support for a game scenario (buttons and analog sticks), controller support for UI (selection, moving between menu items, invoking the keyboard), and how to account for the form factor (overscan, landscape, device and controller detection).
